# Rock Paper Scissors

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game, where rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
